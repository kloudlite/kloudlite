  - OpenShift OperatorHub

## 📊 TBD - Deferred to Future Phases

### Metrics & Observability (Post-GA)
These features are intentionally deferred to focus on core platform functionality:

- **TBD: Resource dashboard with real-time metrics**
- **TBD: Monitoring and observability platform**
- **TBD: Prometheus/Grafana integration**
- Cost tracking dashboards
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource utilization visualizations
- Advanced analytics

**Rationale:** Core platform functionality and distribution take priority. Metrics can be added once the platform is stable and customers can use their existing monitoring solutions initially.
