  Cloud Native RemoteLocal Environments to build distributed applications.
</p>

Welcome to Kloudlite! Kloudlite is a development environment platform designed to enhance productivity for developers working on distributed applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, Kloudlite provides a seamless bridge between local systems and remote environments, ensuring efficient and effective development workflows.

## Features

- **Remote and Local Environment Sync**: Kloudlite synchronizes configurations and secrets between your local development containers (KL boxes) and remote Kubernetes environments, allowing for a consistent and seamless development experience.
  
- **Low-Latency Connectivity**: Unlike traditional remote IDEs, Kloudlite utilizes WireGuard to establish a network mesh that connects your local environment with remote services, drastically reducing latency and improving response times.

- **Development Containers with SSH**: Each local development container is equipped with an SSH server, enabling direct connectivity from your local IDE. This setup supports real-time code synchronization and debugging.

- **Service Interception for Debugging**: Developers can intercept applications running inside the remote environment to debug in real-time, enhancing the ability to test and troubleshoot during the development phase.

- **Collaborative Coding**: Kloudlite supports multiple developers working in the same environment simultaneously. This feature is ideal for team projects and collaborative coding sessions, allowing for real-time interaction and updates.

- **Stateless Workloads**: The stateless nature of Kloudlite workloads facilitates easy cloning and feature environment setups, making it simpler to manage and scale your development efforts.

- **Extensibility**: Easily add external services to your Kubernetes workspace, enhancing the functionality and integrability of your development environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kloudlite, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**:
   - Install the Kloudlite CLI from [Kloudlite Installation Page](https://kloudlite.com/install).
