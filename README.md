  Cloud Native RemoteLocal Environments to build distributed applications.
</p>

Kloudlite is a remote local environments platform designed to enhance productivity for developers working on distributed applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, Kloudlite provides a seamless bridge between local systems and remote environments, ensuring efficient and effective development workflows.

## Features
- **Isolated and Replicable Local Development Containers**: Kloudlite provides developers with isolated local development containers that seamlessly connect with remote environments. This setup ensures a replicable development process that is both efficient and consistent across different machines and team members.

- **Comprehensive Environment Management**: Kloudlite environments handle configurations, secrets, and access to managed services, applications, and external services efficiently. These environments are designed to meet all your development needs. Since they are stateless and ephemeral, developers can easily clone them for isolated, parallel development efforts.

- **Application/Service Interception**: With Kloudlite, developers can intercept and replace an application or service running in the remote environment with the version running in their local IDE. This feature allows for real-time testing and debugging before proceeding with builds and deployments, significantly enhancing development efficiency.

- **Collaborative Development**: Kloudlite supports collaborative development by allowing multiple developers to connect to the same environment. Team members can intercept their respective services and debug collaboratively, directly from their local machines, fostering teamwork and streamlining problem-solving.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kloudlite, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**:
   - Install the Kloudlite CLI from [Kloudlite Installation Page](https://kloudlite.com/install).
   - Set up WireGuard on your system to connect with Kloudlite environments.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Configure your local KL boxes and sync them with the remote Kubernetes environments.
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies and services are configured as per your project needs.

3. **Development**:
   - Start your development by connecting your local IDE to the development container via SSH.
   - Utilize the service interception feature to debug and test your applications dynamically.
