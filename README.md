  Cloud Native RemoteLocal Environments to build distributed applications.
</p>

Kloudlite is a remote local environments platform designed to enhance productivity for developers working on distributed applications. By leveraging Kubernetes, Kloudlite provides a seamless bridge between local systems and remote environments, ensuring efficient and effective development workflows.

## Features
- **Isolated and Replicable Local Development Containers**: Kloudlite provides developers with isolated local development containers that seamlessly connect with remote environments. This setup ensures a replicable development process that is both efficient and consistent across different machines and team members.

- **Comprehensive Environment Management**: Kloudlite environments are designed to manage configurations, secrets, applications and external services, ensuring that all your development needs are met within a unified platform.

- **Application/Service Interception**: With Kloudlite, developers can intercept and replace an application or service running in the remote environment with the version running in their local IDE. This feature allows for real-time testing and debugging before proceeding with builds and deployments, significantly enhancing development efficiency.

- **Collaborative Development**: Kloudlite supports collaborative development by allowing multiple developers to connect to the same environment. Team members can intercept their respective services and debug collaboratively, directly from their local machines, fostering teamwork and streamlining problem-solving.
