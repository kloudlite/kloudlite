**Kloudlite** is an open-source platform designed to provide seamless and secure development environments for building distributed applications. It connects local workspaces with remote Kubernetes environments via a WireGuard network, allowing developers to access services and resources with production-level parity. With Kloudlite, there’s no need for build or deploy steps during development— With service intercepts, your changes are reflected in real time, enhancing productivity and reducing the development loop.

![Frame 1000001531](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df03c018-786c-4679-aca5-15511b959331)


## Key Features:
- **WireGuard Network Integration:** Connects the workspace to environments and services using WireGuard.
- **Synchronized Workspaces:** Keeps workspace configurations and secrets in sync with connected environments and services.
- **Nix-based Package Management:** Utilizes Nix for managing workspace packages.
- **Stateless Environments:** Supports ephemeral environments without overhead.
- **Concurrent Development Support:** Enables multiple developers to work on the same environment simultaneously.
- **Application Intercepts:** Allows developers to intercept applications running in environments, redirecting their network traffic to the workspace
