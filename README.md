Kloudlite is a platform designed to enhance developers' productivity by providing seamless, secure, **production-parity development environments**. It connects local systems and remote environments via a WireGuard network, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy distributed applications efficiently. Kloudlite eliminates the need for separate configurations by syncing configurations and secrets across environments. It supports collaborative coding, real-time testing, and debugging.
