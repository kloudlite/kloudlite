# Apps Folder - Golang Project

Welcome to the Apps folder of our Golang project. This folder contains the main applications or executables that are built using the packages and libraries of the project. Each subdirectory within the Apps folder represents a separate application, and the applications are organized in a way that makes it easy to understand their purpose and usage.

## Structure

The structure of the Apps folder is as follows:

```
apps/
  ├── app1/
  │   ├── main.go
  │   ├── config/
  │   │   └── config.yaml
  │   └── ...
  ├── app2/
  │   ├── main.go
  │   ├── config/
  │   │   └── config.yaml
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

Each subdirectory within `apps` represents a separate application. The `main.go` file in each subdirectory contains the entry point of the application. Additionally, each application may have its own `config` folder containing configuration files, such as YAML or JSON files.

## Usage

To build and run an application from the `apps` folder, navigate to the application's directory and use the `go build` command followed by the `./<app-name>` command to execute the generated binary. For example, to build and run `app1`, follow these steps:

```
cd apps/app1
go build
./app1
```

Note that the binary name may be different depending on your system and the configuration of the project. Replace `<app-name>` with the appropriate name for your environment.
