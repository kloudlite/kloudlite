Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Before you start working on your contribution, please review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork the repository**: Create a fork of the main repository to your personal GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes and create a pull request when you're ready to submit your contribution.
    
2.  **Create a branch**: In your fork, create a new branch for each feature or bugfix you're working on. This helps to keep your work organized and makes it easier for us to review your changes. Use a descriptive branch name, such as `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-123`.
    
3.  **Keep your fork in sync**: Regularly update your fork with the latest changes from the main repository to avoid merge conflicts.
    

### Code Standards

Please adhere to the following code standards when contributing to the project:

1.  **Coding style**: Follow the project's coding style and conventions, which may include indentation, naming conventions, and code organization. If the project uses a linter or a code formatter (e.g., Prettier, ESLint), make sure to configure your development environment accordingly.
    
2.  **Comment your code**: Add comments to your code to explain its purpose, especially for complex or non-obvious implementations. This will help other contributors understand your work and make future maintenance easier.
    
3.  **Write tests**: Whenever possible, write tests for your changes to ensure that they work correctly and to prevent regressions. Make sure that all existing tests pass before submitting your pull request.
    
4.  **Commit messages**: Write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you've made. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" instead of "Added feature") and keep your commit messages concise but informative.
    

### Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure your code is up to date**: Merge the latest changes from the main repository into your branch to minimize the risk of merge conflicts.
    
2.  **Test your changes**: Run the project's test suite and verify that all tests pass. Make sure that your changes do not introduce new errors or warnings.
    
3.  **Submit a pull request**: Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository. In the PR description, provide a clear and concise explanation of your changes, including any issues or features they address. If your PR fixes a specific issue, reference it using the appropriate syntax (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    
4.  **Respond to feedback**: After submitting your PR, the maintainers and other contributors may provide feedback or request changes. Be prepared to engage in a constructive discussion and address any concerns or suggestions they may have.
    

### Code of Conduct

Please follow the project's Code of Conduct in all your interactions with the community. We expect all contributors to treat each other with respect and maintain a professional and inclusive environment.

By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a high-quality codebase and foster a welcoming and collaborative community. We appreciate your contribution and look forward to working with you!
