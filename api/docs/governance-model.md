This document outlines the governance model for our open-source project. The goal is to ensure a transparent, inclusive, and collaborative environment for all community members.

### Roles and Responsibilities

1.  **Project Lead**: The Project Lead is responsible for the overall direction and management of the project. This includes setting the project vision, defining the roadmap, and making high-level decisions. The Project Lead also serves as the primary point of contact for external organizations and represents the project in public forums.
    
2.  **Core Team**: The Core Team consists of experienced contributors who have demonstrated a strong commitment to the project. They are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests, managing releases, and providing guidance to other contributors. Core Team members are also expected to help maintain a healthy and inclusive community.
    
3.  **Contributors**: Contributors are individuals who contribute code, documentation, translations, or other resources to the project. They are encouraged to participate in discussions, submit bug reports, and contribute to the project's improvement.
    
4.  **Users**: Users are individuals or organizations that use the project in their work or personal projects. They provide valuable feedback, report issues, and help spread the word about the project.
    

### Decision-Making Process

1.  **Consensus-based decisions**: Whenever possible, decisions should be made through consensus among Core Team members and active contributors. This involves discussing proposals, considering feedback, and reaching an agreement that is acceptable to all parties involved.
    
2.  **Voting**: In cases where consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be called. Core Team members are eligible to vote, and a majority is required for a decision to be approved. The Project Lead has the authority to break a tie.
    
3.  **Issue resolution**: If conflicts arise between community members, the Core Team will work together to resolve the issue in a fair and transparent manner. The Project Lead may step in to make a final decision if necessary.
    
4.  **Changes to governance**: Any proposed changes to this governance model should be discussed and agreed upon by the Core Team. Major changes may require a vote or wider consultation with the community.
    

### Community Involvement

1.  **Open communication**: All project-related discussions should be conducted in public forums, such as issue trackers, mailing lists, or chat platforms. This ensures transparency and allows all community members to participate in the decision-making process.
    
2.  **Mentorship and support**: Core Team members and experienced contributors are encouraged to provide mentorship and support to new contributors. This helps foster a welcoming and inclusive community, and promotes the project's growth.
    
3.  **Code of Conduct**: All community members are expected to adhere to the project's Code of Conduct. Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal from the project.
    

By following this governance model, we aim to create a well-organized, transparent, and collaborative environment for our open-source project. We welcome feedback and suggestions from the community to help improve and evolve our governance model over time.
