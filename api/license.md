Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such derivative works in Source or Object form.

5.  No Warranty

The Work is provided "as is," and the Licensor provides no warranty, either express or implied, including but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

6.  Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this Work, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

7.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

8.  Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

10.  Miscellaneous

If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Licensor.

11.  Trademarks

If the dispute is not resolved through mediation, either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration under the rules of an internationally recognized arbitration institution.

14.  Severability

If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this License shall remain in full force and effect. Any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be modified or reformed to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable, while maintaining the original intent of the parties to the greatest extent possible.

15.  No Assignment
