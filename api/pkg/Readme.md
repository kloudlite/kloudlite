# Golang Project - Pkg Directory

Welcome to the `pkg` directory of our Golang project. This directory contains the packages that are meant to be reusable and shared across multiple components within the project or even outside the project. These packages are designed with proper abstractions to make them easily maintainable and extensible.

## Structure

The structure of the `pkg` directory is as follows:

```
pkg/
  ├── package1/
  │   ├── package1.go
  │   ├── package1_test.go
  │   ├── doc.go
  │   └── ...
  ├── package2/
  │   ├── package2.go
  │   ├── package2_test.go
  │   ├── doc.go
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

Each subdirectory within `pkg` represents a separate package. The packages are named in a way that describes their functionality.

## Usage

To use a package from the `pkg` directory, simply import it in your Go code using the project's import path. For example, if your project's import path is `github.com/username/project`, and you want to import `package1`, you would do:

```go
import "github.com/username/project/pkg/package1"
```
