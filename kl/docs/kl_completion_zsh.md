## kl completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

```
Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(kl completion zsh); compdef _kl kl

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	kl completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kl"

#### macOS:

	kl completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_kl

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

```

### Options

```
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
  -h, --help   help for zsh
```
