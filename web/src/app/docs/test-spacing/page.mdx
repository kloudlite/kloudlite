## Introduction

This page demonstrates proper spacing and typography in our documentation system. Notice how elements have appropriate breathing room.

### Key Features

Our documentation system includes:

- MDX support for rich content
- Search UI (ready for content)
- Mobile-friendly design
- Professional typography

## Sample Content

Here's how different elements will look:

### Code Block Example

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
  return "This is a code block";
}
```

### Inline Code

You can use `inline code` within paragraphs to highlight technical terms or code snippets.

> This is a blockquote that shows how quoted content will appear in the documentation. It should have proper spacing and a visual indicator.

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:

- First item with some content
- Second item with more details
- Third item to complete the list

And here's an ordered list:

1. Step one in the process
2. Step two with explanation
3. Step three to finish

### Tables

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Sidebar Navigation | âœ… Complete | Professional sidebar with navigation |
| Table of Contents | âœ… Complete | Sticky TOC with active states |
| MDX Support | âœ… Complete | Full MDX rendering support |
| Search UI | ðŸš§ In Progress | Search functionality coming soon |

### Links and Emphasis

You can create [links to other pages](/docs) and use **bold text** for emphasis or *italic text* for subtle emphasis.

## Advanced Examples

### Nested Lists

1. First level item
   - Nested bullet point
   - Another nested item
     - Even deeper nesting
     - With multiple items
   
2. Second level item
   - With its own nested items
   - And proper spacing

### Complex Code Examples

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  roles: Role[];
}

class UserService {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // Implementation details
    const user = await db.users.findById(id);
    return user;
  }
}
```

### Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph followed by a list, then more content:

The Kloudlite platform offers several key benefits:

- **Fast Development**: Instant cloud environments

## Conclusion

This page demonstrates that our documentation system properly handles:

1. **Spacing**: Appropriate margins and padding between elements
2. **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with different heading levels
3. **Code Blocks**: Syntax highlighting and proper formatting
