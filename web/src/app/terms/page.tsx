          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the 
            exclusive property of Kloudlite and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, 
            trademark, and other laws. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The materials on Kloudlite are provided on an 'as is' basis. Kloudlite makes no warranties, 
            expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, 
            without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a 
            particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            In no event shall Kloudlite or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without 
            limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising 
            out of the use or inability to use Kloudlite, even if Kloudlite or a Kloudlite authorized 
            representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. 
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations 
            of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">9. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without 
            prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without 
            limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms. If you wish to terminate 
            your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">10. Governing Law</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction 
            in which Kloudlite operates, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure 
            to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">11. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            Kloudlite reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at 
            any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any 
            new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions 
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
